# Voting-system-in-C
This is a C-programming project on Voting System, that I created in my 1st semester of BIM. The program can be run either as an employee or as the board of director member of the company. This project can be really useful in business setups to take feedback from the employees, regarding the company's present scenario, in the form of their votes.
